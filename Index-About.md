# Grok Grinder

**A series of tutorials to help you get up to speed quickly on common software technologies**

Its a place to consolidate the day to day learning so that its learnt properly and therefore can actually be used again. Maybe you won't remember all the details, but you know have the detailed walkthroughs and POCs that show you how to get up and running.

The name Grok Grinder comes from Devastator the transformer that sucks everything in. Has a [Vortex Grinder](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Vortex_Grinder) an artificial black hole that sucks in nearby objects and breaks them down and all useful materials are absorbed and the rest are expelled from his back. 

### Structure

Keep it simple, lets have three types of items Index pages, Articles and Topics.

* **Index Pages** - we have index pages which are lists of potential and partially completed articles.
* **Articles** - A standard alone tutorial or guide that explains some aspect of coding.
* **Topics** - a group of related articles with an order implied by the date they were written.
* **Tags** - used like normal blog tags

So the idea is that you write lists of potential articles in an index page. 

If you keep doing the same thing, but can't quite remember how to do it, then you keep adding notes in the index page.

Eventually you end up with enough material to write an article.

When you have multiple articles you can link them with a topic, which is simply a homepage for that group of articles.

You can create multiple index pages based on the topic.

Articles don't need to be complete, you can still be working on them even when they have been promoted from the index page.

Name article files with the generic name first and then the identifier so you can scan down them and read them (??) or maybe have folders, cos names will get really long? Its renaming and moving articles that gets difficult???

Lets try the topic-articlename format:

* AspnetCore-Using-Configuration-Builder-ConsoleApps.md
* AspNetCore-Security-Securing-A-Website-With-OIDC.md

Use microsoft standard names where possible. They have already done the hard work of thinking up 

**Where should code go?** Obvs in git

### Design

Be focused mainly on markdown so you can easily start new articles and take notes on the fly as you are working which can then be turned into a blog post with minimum effort.

Start with resources to docs at the top of each article you want to encourage yourself and everyone else to RTFM.

Have filtering or tags so that can easily see if its .net5.0 or dotnetcore2.1 and also the ide used

Want to list related articles together so that you can see them as a tutorial so that you can find them easily. 

## Articles

* Citrus the mouse over tag item which you did based off the plural sight video.
* Citrus the graphs lined up using CSS
* Razor Pages - Client validation
* Bootstrap nav bars. Just the basics
* Bootstrap grids: Formatting and layout, fluid etc have a sample bootstrap 4 with the appropriate tags etc so you know how to actually load these up.
* Flex box how to use it to align basic elements. Do a practice page.
* CSS how to create a page that you can edit the CSS inline in the webpate and see the affect (see pluaral sight video.)
* Selenium Waits examples and maybe extension methods that you can use.
* Powershell: The integration test powershell to start and stop a service
* Powershell: Executing scripts from the internet like how chocolatey is installed (and ansible)
* IdentityServer4: In memory sample video ([Hanselman/Dom Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyUD-CeBSiE)) ([IdentiyServer4.QuickStart.UI](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI))
* Getting Started with WSL commandline examples ([MSDN - WSL Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/reference))
